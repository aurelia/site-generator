          <h3>Aurelia Release Notes - Early November 2017</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by AureliaEffect on November 10, 2017</p>
          <p>As always, the Aurelia Team continues to fix bugs, add new features and make tons of improvements throughout the framework. In this set of releases, we&#x27;ve got a minor breaking change to our dialog plugin. We&#x27;ve also converted our testing library to TypeScript. While we&#x27;ve made no changes to the API or behavior, we&#x27;ve bumped the major version since the improved, more-accurate typings may affect some TypeScript users. Finally, we&#x27;ve launched another major set of enhancements to the CLI and made our initial launch of the HTTP Mocking library. Huge thanks to Thomas Schlage [https://github.com/fragsalat] for his work on the new library.</p>

At the same time, we&#x27;ve completely overhauled our site [http://aurelia.io/] and documentation technology, opening the way for better docs and learning to come.</p>
