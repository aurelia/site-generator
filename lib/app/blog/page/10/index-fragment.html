          <p>It&#x27;s been an amazing journey since we first announced Aurelia [http://blog.durandal.io/2015/01/26/introducing-aurelia/] and now we&#x27;re finally at our biggest milestone yet. Today we&#x27;re happy to announce the full availability of the Aurelia Release Candidate. You can get the bits through npm, jspm, bower or directly on Github now.</p>

          <p>You&#x27;ve been diligent in keeping up with Aurelia updates, and so today you update your libraries. Or perhaps you just started using Aurelia today and are pulling down the latest release...but something&#x27;s not right. Some d.ts files are missing. Things aren&#x27;t compiling correctly and your app is broken. What do you do now!?</p>

          <h3>Aurelia Workshop at NDC Oslo</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by AureliaEffect on June 2, 2016</p>
          <p>Next week at NDC Oslo, Rob Eisenberg will be presenting a two-day workshop titled &quot;Modern Web Applications with Aurelia&quot;. Over the course of two days, you&#x27;ll cover every major topic in Aurelia development through a combination of both lecture-style learning and interactive, collaborative application building. When you complete these two days, you won&#x27;t only know how to build applications with Aurelia, but you&#x27;ll also have a slick application you helped to build as part of the process.</p>

          <p>It&#x27;s release Tuesday again so we&#x27;re pushing out incremental patches to our libraries. As usual, the change log is below for those who like to stay up to date on all the details. As we approach our Release Candidate, some of our libraries are available in a &quot;pre-release&quot; form now too.</p>

          <p>Hopefully you saw our big announcement yesterday [http://blog.durandal.io/2016/05/23/aurelia-shadow-dom-v1-slots-prerelease/] about support for Shadow DOM v1 Slots in Aurelia. It&#x27;s an exciting milestone for us on our road towards Release Candidate and as part of our commitment to web standards. Today, we have a number of patch releases to various Aurelia libraries. The list is relatively small. You can read the details below.</p>
