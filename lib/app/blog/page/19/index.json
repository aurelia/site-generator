I showed the \"reverse binding\" technique for Angular 2.0. Today I'm going to show how the Angular 2.0 Forms Model [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1US9h0ORqBltl71TlEU6s76ix8SUnOLE2jabHVg9xxEA/] can be used instead. I'll also show Aurelia next to it, so you can see the difference. Both examples will use the same Contact model.","updatedAt":"2015-03-17T15:38:04.000Z","publishedAt":"2015-03-17T15:32:38.000Z","links":{"static":"blog/2015/3/3/aurelia-angular-2-0-code-side-by-side-part-2","html":"blog/2015/3/3/aurelia-angular-2-0-code-side-by-side-part-2/index.html","fragment":"blog/2015/3/3/aurelia-angular-2-0-code-side-by-side-part-2/index-fragment.html","self":"blog/2015/3/3/aurelia-angular-2-0-code-side-by-side-part-2/index.json"}},{"name":"Aurelia & Angular 2.0 Code Side by Side","slug":"aurelia-and-angular-2-code-side-by-side","author":{"name":"AureliaEffect"},"description":"Showing the same code for the same tasks, side-by-side in Aurelia and Angular 2.0.","updatedAt":"2015-03-17T16:40:31.000Z","publishedAt":"2015-03-16T13:44:00.000Z","links":{"static":"blog/2015/3/2/aurelia-and-angular-2-code-side-by-side","html":"blog/2015/3/2/aurelia-and-angular-2-code-side-by-side/index.html","fragment":"blog/2015/3/2/aurelia-and-angular-2-code-side-by-side/index-fragment.html","self":"blog/2015/3/2/aurelia-and-angular-2-code-side-by-side/index.json"}},{"name":"Aurelia - Status - March 2015","slug":"aurelia-status-march-2015","author":{"name":"AureliaEffect"},"description":"Little over a month ago, we announced the public preview of Aurelia [http://aurelia.io/].
