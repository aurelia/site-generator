          <h3>Aurelia Training Recordings</h3>
          <p>Since we announced the Aurelia Virtual Training [https://www.picatic.com/modern-javascript-and-aurelia] opportunity we&#x27;ve received tons of responses. The biggest request we&#x27;ve had is the community&#x27;s desire to gain access to recordings of the trainings after the event. In response to this, we&#x27;re going to make recordings of the training available to each ticket purchaser.</p>

          <h3>Aurelia Interface Update</h3>
          <p>For some time, we&#x27;ve been working on a component library for Aurelia: a suite of controls that would enable hybrid mobile development on iOS and Android, as well as desktop and browser-based development by leveraging Material Design. In today&#x27;s update, we&#x27;d like to share with you a bit about our journey, where we&#x27;re at and what the future looks like.</p>
