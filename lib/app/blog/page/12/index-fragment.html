          <p>The Aurelia team is hard at work preparing for our Release Candidate...but that&#x27;s not all we&#x27;re working on. We&#x27;re always looking for ways to improve tooling, debugging and collaboration with community members and other vendors along the way.</p>

          <h3>Aurelia Late March Patch Update</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by AureliaEffect on March 29, 2016</p>
          <p>In the last month we&#x27;ve accomplished a couple of major goals on our way to the official v1 release of Aurelia: updating to Babel 6, removing required external polyfills and dual compatibility with JSPM 16 and 17. This week, we&#x27;ve got a few fixes and some extra goodies.</p>

          <p>This week we launched updates of Aurelia libraries built with Babel 6. We had one library that we weren&#x27;t able to update at that time: aurelia-i18n.</p>
