          <h3>Bundling an Aurelia Application</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">June 23, 2015</span>
          <p>Aurelia is a next generation framework that promotes good design patterns and practices. The next version of HTTP, HTTP/2 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2], may very well obsolete the necessity of creating bundles in the future, but we are not there just yet. Nobody likes to see a production application making 256 requests when loading. That&#x27;s why Aurelia takes bundling very seriously. Read on to find out how to get your app bundled up for deploy using our new CLI.</p>

          <p>Next week, Rob Eisenberg will be presenting at the Norwegian Developers Conference [http://www.ndcoslo.com/] in Oslo, Norway. He&#x27;ll be giving two presentations. The first, The New JavaScript: ES6 [http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-30202], is designed to bring you up to speed on the latest developments in JavaScript and help you catch a vision of where the language is heading in the future. The second talk, Aurelia: Next Generation Web Apps [http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-30201], will show you how a modern, ES6-based framework can make building complex JavaScript clients effortless. If you are in or around Oslo, we hope you will come and check it out.</p>

          <p>This week we are really excited to have our first community member highlight post! Manuel Guilbault [https://github.com/manuel-guilbault/] is a Canadian-born, Paris-based developer, where he works as a consultant in the financial sector. Passionate about software craftsmanship, agility and lean principles, he loves to learn and debate about how we do things, why we do them this way and how they can be improved. This week we&#x27;ve invited Manuel to guest blog with us and share the work he did implementing a new custom attribute that&#x27;s shipping in the next Aurelia update.</p>

          <h3>Porting an Angular 2.0 App to Aurelia</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">May 20, 2015</span>
          <p>Recently, Joe Eames [https://twitter.com/josepheames] had a nice PluralSight [http://www.pluralsight.com] webinar demonstrating some of the features of Angular 2.0. We thought &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool to see the same app built with Aurelia?&quot; It seemed like a good opportunity to show what we feel makes Aurelia so easy-to-use and efficient.</p>
