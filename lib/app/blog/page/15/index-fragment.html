          <h3>Aurelia Beta Week - Day 2 - Plugins</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">November 17, 2015</span>
          <p>Yesterday, after months of work, we launched the Beta 1 release of Aurelia. From the beginning, one of the most important aspects of Aurelia&#x27;s architecture has been its modularity and its pluggable design. In light of that, we wanted to dedicate one of this week&#x27;s posts to plugins: What are they? What is available? and What are our plans?</p>
