          <p>&quot;Aurelia For Real World Web Applications&quot; is for anyone wanting to dip their feet or dive head first into the Aurelia JavaScript framework. The book assumes no previous knowledge of Aurelia or any other JavaScript framework, and aims to be a comprehensive be all and end all resource on Aurelia. The book helps guide you through setting up a development environment, offers advice on structuring your applications and how to build components. At the end of the book you will take all of the knowledge you have learned in previous chapters and build actual working web applications (with full source code provided).</p>
