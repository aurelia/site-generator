    <h1>Introducing Monterey</h1>

    <p>One of Aurelia's greatest strengths is the dedication and ingenuity of its community. Today we'd like to introduce you to a community group that is building all sorts of tools and extensions for Aurelia. Fittingly, they call themselves the Aurelia Tools Team. Read on to hear directly from their team lead, Adriatic, about the exciting new technology they are building for Aurelia developers.</p>
<p>Today, we are ready to share a brand new approach to Aurelia application development. Instead of creating yet another IDE, the Aurelia Tools team's approach has been to integrate all development tools, including various IDEs, CLI tools, file managers, code editors and module loader managers into a single top level command center application. We named this application <em>Monterey</em>, hoping that the name will instill the same bliss in our users as a visit to Monterey's Fisherman Wharf did so many years ago to one of our own members (Adriatic). At the moment, this name is just a code name. In the future, you will have an opportunity to choose the real, meaningful name.</p>

<p>A much more abstract definition of Monterey is used in the 
<a href="https://github.com/monterey-framework/monterey/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a>
 file from the 
<a href="https://github.com/monterey-framework/monterey" target="_blank">Monterey Github repository</a>
:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monterey is an extensible application that provides a graphical user interface for a collection of tools to simplify the creation, configuration and maintenance of Aurelia applications.</p>
