Let A Collection of Modern JavaScript Modules Rather than being a monolithic framework, Aurelia is broken down into a collection of feature-oriented modules. Examples of feature modules include metadata, dependency injection, binding, templating, router and more. Each module is written using ECMAScript (aka JavaScript) or TypeScript (a strict superset of JavaScript that adds compile-time type checking). Many of these modules can be used individually in any type of JavaScript project, including Node.js. A Powerful Platform for Building Apps While Aurelia Open Source With all the power and capability that Aurelia offers, you might expect it to have an expensive licensing model or be closed source, but neither is true.

When the page is first loaded, this is the initial request that returns HTML content. When the browser processes the HTML content, it spawns more requests to load resources like JS, CSS and images. It also executes JavaScript and sends AJAX requests to the server. To make this process efficient, we need to compress the assets and make fewer (possibly less than 6) requests to load everything we need. Fortunately, static resources can be cached and only downloaded the first time. If they cause slowness, it happens on the first page load only and may be tolerable.
