The big exception, of course, is dynamic composition allows you to dynamically render views and view-models after the page has loaded.\n\nWhen using Aurelia's `<compose>` element, inside of the view-model being used, you have access to all of Aurelia's standard view lifecycle events, such as `attached`, as well as the other callback hooks.\n\n## [Basic Composition](aurelia-doc://section/2/version/1.0.0)\n\nUsing the `<compose>` element, we are going to be dynamically composing a view.\n\n<code-listing heading=\"hello-world.html\">\n  <source-code lang=\"HTML\">\n    <template>\n      <compose view-model=\"./compose-me\"></compose>\n    </template>\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\n<code-listing heading=\"compose-me${context.language.fileExtension}\">\n  <source-code lang=\"ES 2016\">\n    export class ComposeMe {\n    }\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\n<code-listing heading=\"compose-me.html\">\n  <source-code lang=\"HTML\">\n    <template>\n      <p>Hello World!!</p>\n    </template>\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\nInside of our `hello-world.html` template, we are using the `<compose>` element and passing through a view-model (without file extension) to be rendered. The view-model is just a standard class, like you create elsewhere in an Aurelia application.\n\nBecause Aurelia is a convention based framework, the `<compose>` element knows to use the default convention of loading the matching view for our view-model of the same name.\n\n## [Composing Without a View-Model](aurelia-doc://section/3/version/1.0.0)\n\nIf you're wanting to dynamically compose just a view template without specifying a view-model, all you need to do is omit the `view-model` property and supply a `view`. The result will be that the current view-model will be used as the binding context for our view, allowing you to create HTML partials that take the current properties and methods.\n\n<code-listing heading=\"hello-world.html\">\n  <source-code lang=\"HTML\">\n    <template>\n      <compose view=\"./compose-me.html\"></compose>\n    </template>\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\n<code-listing heading=\"compose-me.html\">\n  <source-code lang=\"HTML\">\n    <template>\n      <p>Hello World!!</p>\n    </template>\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\nFor the `view` property, we need to specify a file extension, unlike the view-model property, which does not have an extension. The above example will work the same way as our first example, except we're not supplying our own view-model, it's inheriting the binding context from where the `compose` element is used.\n\n## [Passing Through Data](aurelia-doc://section/4/version/1.0.0)\n\nUsing what we learned above, we can dynamically compose view-models and views and pass through additional data via the `model` property on the `<compose>` element.\n\nWe are going to be building an example which will dynamically render a view/view-model pair and accept an object of provided values.\n\n<code-listing heading=\"hello-world${context.language.fileExtension}\">\n  <source-code lang=\"ES 2016\">\n    export class HelloWorld {\n        constructor() {\n          this.data = {\n            name: 'John Doe',\n            company: 'Cool Co.',\n            likes: ['Javascript', 'fruit', 'jelly']\n          };\n        }\n    }\n  </source-code>\n  <source-code lang=\"Typescript\">\n    export class HelloWorld {\n      private data = {\n        name: 'John Doe',\n        company: 'Cool Co.',\n        likes: ['Javascript', 'fruit', 'jelly']\n      };\n    }\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\n<code-listing heading=\"hello-world.html\">\n  <source-code lang=\"HTML\">\n    <template>\n      <compose view-model=\"./compose-me\" model.bind=\"data\"></compose>\n    </template>\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\n<code-listing heading=\"compose-me${context.language.fileExtension}\">\n  <source-code lang=\"ES 2016\">\n    export class ComposeMe {\n      activate(model) {\n        this.data = model;\n      }\n    }\n  </source-code>\n  <source-code lang=\"Typescript\">\n    export class ComposeMe {\n      private data: any = {};\n\n      activate(model) {\n        this.data = model;\n      }\n    }\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\nIf you have worked with the Aurelia router before and router parameters, you will notice we obtain the provided model object the same way: as the first argument of the `activate` method. We then store the object on our class itself, making it available in our HTML view under a property called `data`.\n\n<code-listing heading=\"compose-me.html\">\n  <source-code lang=\"HTML\">\n    <template>\n      <p>Hello, my name is ${data.name} and my company is ${data.company}.</p>\n      <p>My likes include:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li repeat.for=\"like of data.likes\">${like}</li>\n      </ol>\n    </template>\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\nNotice how we are referencing values on our provided object, `name` and `company`, and then looping over an array of provided strings for `likes`.\n\n> Info\n> While the full view lifecycle (created, bind, attached, detached, unbind) is supported during dynamic composition, the full navigation lifecycle is not. Only the `activate` hook is enabled. It receives a single parameter which is the `model` and can optionally return a promise if executing an asynchronous task.\n"}
